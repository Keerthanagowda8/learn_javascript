A combinator in CSS is something that defines the relationship between two selectors.
It tells the browser how elements are related in the HTML structure and which ones to style.

Descendant Combinator (space)
Selects all elements inside another element (no matter how deep).
<div>
  <p>This is inside div</p>
  <section>
    <p>This is also inside div</p>
  </section>
</div>

<p>This is outside div</p>

div p {
  color: blue;
}
All <p> tags inside <div> (even nested ones) become blue.
The <p> outside <div> is not affected.


Child Combinator (>)
Selects only the direct child elements (not nested deeper)<div>
  <p>Direct child</p>
  <section>
    <p>Nested child</p>
  </section>
</div>

div > p {
  color: green;
}
Only the first <p> (directly inside <div>) becomes green.
The <p> inside <section> is ignored.

Adjacent Sibling Combinator (+)
Selects the first element immediately after another (same parent)
<h2>Heading</h2>
<p>Paragraph just after h2</p>
<p>Another paragraph</p>

h2 + p {
  color: red;
}
Only the first <p> after <h2> is red.
The next paragraph is not affected.

General Sibling Combinator (~)
Selects all elements after a given element (same parent)
<h2>Heading</h2>
<p>First paragraph</p>
<p>Second paragraph</p>

h2 ~ p {
  color: purple;
}

All <p> tags that come after <h2> (and share the same parent) become purple.
