DOM (Document Object Model)

The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
It represents the entire HTML document in a hierarchical (tree-like) structure, so that developers can easily access and modify its content.
It defines how HTML elements can be accessed, traversed, and manipulated using programming languages like JavaScript.
Developers can access and manipulate elements using their tag name, id, class, or attributes, through methods and properties provided by the DOM API.

Structure of the DOM

The DOM is represented as a tree structure called the DOM tree.
It consists of branches and nodes.
Each node represents a part of the document — such as an element, attribute, or text.
All nodes are connected through branches, forming a hierarchy.
The root node is the <html> element, and every node in the DOM tree ends with an object that can be accessed or manipulated.


document.getElementById("id")

This method is used to select an HTML element by its unique id attribute.
It searches the entire document and returns the first element that matches the given ID.
Return type: It returns a single element object, or null if no element is found

document.getElementsByClassName("className")

This method finds all elements in the document that have the specified class name.
It searches the whole HTML page (or a specific section if called on an element) and returns a live HTMLCollection — meaning if new elements with that class are added later, they automatically appear in the collection.
Return type: HTMLCollection (similar to an array, but not exactly an array)
if className doesnt exist empty collection is returned

document.getElementsByName("name")

This method finds all elements that have a specific name attribute (mostly used for form elements).
It returns a NodeList (not HTMLCollection) of all elements with that name.
Return type: NodeList (a collection of elements that can be looped using for or forEach)
if Name doesnt exist empty nodelist is returned

document.getElementsByTagName("tagName")

This method finds all elements with a specific HTML tag name, like "p", "div", or "li".
It returns a live HTMLCollection — so if new tags are added dynamically, they’ll appear automatically in the result.
Return type: HTMLCollection
if TagName doesnt exist empty collection is returned

document.querySelector("selector")

querySelector() is used to select the first element that matches a given CSS selector (like an id, class, or tag).
It scans the document from top to bottom and stops as soon as it finds the first match.
How it works:
We can use any CSS-style selector — for example:
#id for ID
.class for class
tag for tag name
or even a combination like "div > p" or "ul li:first-child"
Return type:It returns a single Element object, or null if no element matches the selector.

document.querySelectorAll("selector")

querySelectorAll() is used to select all elements that match a given CSS selector.
It returns a collection of all matches — not just the first one.
How it works:
It looks through the entire document and gathers every element that matches the selector,
but unlike getElementsByClassName, it returns a static NodeList, meaning it does not update automatically if new elements are added later.
Return type:It returns a NodeList (which looks like an array) of all matching elements.


innerHTML
innerHTML is used to get or set the HTML code inside an element.
If you use it to get, it returns the element’s content including any HTML tags.
If you use it to set, it replaces the entire inner HTML of that element with new content (you can include tags too).
Return Type:String – containing HTML code or text

textContent
textContent is used to get or set only the text inside an element — it ignores HTML tags.
It reads all the text, even from hidden elements (display:none).
When you set textContent, it removes any HTML tags and adds plain text.
Return Type:String – only the text content (no HTML tags)

innerText
innerText is similar to textContent, but it only returns visible text (it ignores hidden elements).
It also takes into account the CSS styling (like display:none or visibility:hidden).
When you set it, it changes only what’s visible in the page layout
Return Type:String – visible text only

value
value is used with form elements like <input>, <textarea>, or <select> to get or set user-entered data.
If you use it to get, it shows what the user typed or selected.
If you use it to set, it changes the input field’s content.
Return Type:String – the text or number entered in the input.

document.createElement("tagName")
The createElement() method is used to create a new HTML element dynamically using JavaScript.
It does not automatically appear on the webpage when created — you must add (append) it manually using another method like appendChild() or append().
We can add attribute by using setattribute()
You pass the tag name (like 'div', 'p', 'button', etc.) as a string to the method,
and it returns a new element object that you can customize — for example, by adding text, classes, styles, or attributes.
Return Type:It returns an HTMLElement object (a JavaScript representation of the new HTML tag)


A popup box is a small window that appears on the screen to interact with the user — for example, showing a message, asking for confirmation, or collecting input.
In JavaScript, we mainly have three types of popup boxes:
alert()
    The alert() box is used to show a simple message to the user.
    It only has an OK button — the user must click it to continue.
    It is often used for notifications or debugging (like checking variable values).
    When called, it pauses the script until the user clicks “OK.”
    Return type:Undefined (it doesn’t return anything).
confirm()
    The confirm() box is used when you need the user to accept or reject something.
    It shows two buttons — OK and Cancel.
    If the user clicks OK, it returns true; if Cancel, it returns false.
    Return type:Boolean (true or false)
prompt()
    The prompt() box asks the user to enter some text (like a name or age).
    It shows a text box along with OK and Cancel buttons.
    If the user clicks OK, it returns the text entered.
    If the user clicks Cancel, it returns null.
    Return type:String (user input) or null
All these are built-in methods provided by the browser (not HTML)

Event:
An event is any action performed by the user or browser that the webpage can respond to.
Examples: clicking a button, typing text, submitting a form, hovering the mouse, or resizing the window.

Event handling:
Event handling means writing code that will execute when an event occurs.
It connects user actions (like clicking a button) to functions that perform tasks (like showing a message or changing color).

Types of Events

Mouse Events – onclick, ondblclick, onmouseover, onmouseout
Keyboard Events – onkeydown, onkeyup, onkeypress
Form Events – onsubmit, onchange, onfocus, onblur
Window Events – onload, onresize, onscroll

Ways to Handle Events

Inline Event Handling (HTML Level)
We can add the event directly inside an HTML tag using an attribute like onclick

DOM Event Handling (Assigning with JavaScript)
We can get the element using DOM and assign a function to its event property

Using addEventListener() (Modern Method)
This is the preferred and modern method to handle events.
It allows multiple event handlers on the same element.
Syntax: element.addEventListener("event", function);

When an event occurs, the browser automatically passes an event object to the handler function.
It contains details like which key was pressed, which element was clicked, and the mouse position.

Event Propagation (Bubbling and Capturing)

When an event occurs on nested elements, it passes through three phases:
Capturing phase – event moves from the top element to the target.
Target phase – event reaches the target element.
Bubbling phase – event moves back from the target to the outer elements.
By default, JavaScript uses bubbling (inner to outer).

Removing an Event
We can remove an event listener using removeEventListener()

Mouse Events
These events are triggered when the user interacts with the mouse.
They are commonly used for buttons, images, and clickable areas.
onclick – occurs when an element is clicked.
ondblclick – occurs when an element is double-clicked.
onmouseover – occurs when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
onmouseout – occurs when the mouse pointer moves out of an element.
onmousedown – occurs when the mouse button is pressed down.
onmouseup – occurs when the mouse button is released.
onmousemove – occurs when the mouse moves within an element

Keyboard Events
These events occur when the user interacts with the keyboard.
They are often used for forms, shortcuts, and search boxes.
onkeydown – occurs when a key is pressed down.
onkeypress – occurs when a key is pressed and held (deprecated in modern JS).
onkeyup – occurs when a key is released.

Form Events
These events occur when the user interacts with form elements like inputs, checkboxes, or forms.
onsubmit – triggered when a form is submitted.
onchange – triggered when the value of an input or select changes.
onfocus – triggered when an element gains focus (clicked or selected).
onblur – triggered when an element loses focus.
oninput – triggered whenever the user types or changes input text.

Window or Document Events
These events are related to the browser window or document itself.
They are useful for detecting when the page loads, resizes, or scrolls.
onload – occurs when the page or image finishes loading.
onresize – occurs when the browser window is resized.
onscroll – occurs when the user scrolls the page.
onunload – occurs when the page is closed or refreshed.

Focus Events
These are triggered when elements like input fields gain or lose focus.
onfocus – occurs when an element is focused.
onblur – occurs when focus is moved away.

Promise in JavaScript

A Promise is an object that handles asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
It acts as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future, after the asynchronous task finishes.
Promises help avoid “callback hell” and make asynchronous code easier to manage.
A promise can’t switch from failure to success or from success to failure, and it executes only once.

States of a Promise
Pending – Initial state; the result is not yet available. Output: undefined
Fulfilled (Resolved) – Operation completed successfully. Output: value (number, string, or any data)
Rejected – Operation failed. Output: error message

Promise Functions
resolve() – Called when the operation completes successfully.
reject() – Called when the operation fails or returns an error.

The Promise constructor takes a function with two parameters: resolve and reject.
Inside this function, you write the code for the asynchronous task.
If the task completes successfully, you call resolve(value).
If the task fails, you call reject(error).
The .then() method runs when the promise is resolved successfully.
The .catch() method runs when the promise is rejected.
The .finally() method runs after both success or failure — it is mainly used for cleanup or closing messages

There are two main types of storage in JavaScript:

Local Storage

Session Storage

Both are part of the Web Storage API, used to store data in the browser as key-value pairs.
They only store strings, and data must be converted using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() when working with objects.

1. Local Storage

Definition:
Local Storage allows you to store data permanently in the browser.
The data remains even after the browser is closed or the computer is restarted.
Features:
It provides permanent storage until manually deleted.
Storage limit is around 5MB per domain.
Stores data as key–value pairs (both are strings).
Supports CRUD operations – Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Syntax and Methods:
setItem(key, value) – Stores data in key–value form.
localStorage.setItem("name", "Keerthana");

getItem(key) – Retrieves data for a given key.
let user = localStorage.getItem("name");
console.log(user); // Output: Keerthana

removeItem(key) – Deletes a specific key from local storage.
localStorage.removeItem("name");

clear() – Removes all data from local storage.
localStorage.clear();
